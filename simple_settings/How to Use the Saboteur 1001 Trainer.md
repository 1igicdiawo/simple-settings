Here are some tips and tricks to help you master The Saboteur:

- Explore the open world and collect contraband, which is the currency of the game. You can find it in crates, safes, or by looting dead enemies. You can use contraband to buy weapons, ammo, explosives, and perks from the black market dealers.
- Use stealth to your advantage. You can sneak up on enemies and kill them silently with a knife or a garrote. You can also disguise yourself as a Nazi soldier by stealing their uniforms, but be careful not to get too close to other Nazis or they will recognize you.
- Use the environment to your advantage. You can climb buildings, jump across rooftops, hide in haystacks, or use vehicles to escape or ram enemies. You can also sabotage various Nazi structures and vehicles by planting explosives or cutting wires.
- Use your map and compass to find your objectives and points of interest. The map shows you the locations of missions, races, freeplay targets, hiding spots, and black market dealers. The compass shows you the direction of your current objective and the nearest freeplay target.
- Complete missions and freeplay targets to increase the level of resistance in each area. The more resistance you have, the more color and life will return to the city, and the more allies you will have to fight alongside you. You will also unlock new perks and rewards as you progress.

Have fun playing The Saboteur!

The Saboteur is a game that has received mixed reviews from critics and players alike. Some praised its unique visual style, its open-world exploration, and its satisfying action. Others criticized its technical issues, its weak stealth elements, and its inconsistent tone.
 
One of the most striking features of The Saboteur is its use of color. The game starts in black and white, reflecting the oppression and despair of Nazi-occupied Paris. As you complete missions and freeplay targets, you restore color and life to the city, creating a stark contrast between the areas under Nazi control and those under resistance influence. The color also affects the gameplay, as you can blend in better with the crowds in colorful areas, whereas you stand out more in black and white zones.
 
The game also offers a lot of freedom and variety in how you approach your objectives. You can choose to be stealthy or loud, use vehicles or parkour, fight or flee. You can also explore the city and its surroundings, finding hidden collectibles, completing races, or destroying Nazi targets. The game rewards you with contraband, perks, weapons, and outfits for your efforts.
 
However, The Saboteur is not without its flaws. The game suffers from various bugs and glitches that can hamper your enjoyment. The stealth mechanics are poorly implemented, as enemies can spot you easily or ignore you completely. The AI is also erratic and dumb, making some missions too easy or too hard. The story is also inconsistent in tone, switching between serious drama and silly humor.
 
Overall, The Saboteur is a game that has a lot of potential but also a lot of problems. It is a fun and stylish game that can provide hours of entertainment, but it is also a frustrating and flawed game that can test your patience. If you are looking for a different take on World War II games, you might want to give it a try.
